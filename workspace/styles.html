           <p class="p2">A sportbike, or sports bike, is a motorcycle optimized for speed, acceleration, braking, and cornering on paved roads, typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy by comparison with other motorcycles.</p>

            <p class="p2">A cruiser is a motorcycle in the style of American machines from the 1930s to the early 1960s, including those made by Harley-Davidson, Indian, Excelsior and Henderson. The riding position usually places the feet forward and the hands up, with the spine erect or leaning back slightly. Typical cruiser engines emphasize easy rideability and shifting, with plenty of low-end torque but not necessarily large amounts of horsepower. Cruisers with greater performance than usual, including more horsepower, stronger brakes and better suspension, are often called power cruisers.</p>

            <p class="p3">1967 Vespa 150 (Above)</p>
        
            <p class="p2">A scooter is a type of motorcycle with a step-through frame and a platform for the rider's feet. Scooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easy to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper.</p>
